# Game Plan
## Himanshu Jain 


### Breakout Variant
My favourite one was the Pinball Breakout. I really like the idea of combining two different games that people really like and making that into one. Adding the paddle made the pinball game more interactive. 

### general level descriptions
I will be having 3 different levels in the game which the user would unlock by completing the previous level in the game. 

* Level 1: There would be 4 rows and 6 columns. They won't be having space between them and each block would break with 2 hits.

* Level 2: There would be 4 rows and 6 columns. The 2nd row would be having blocks that would require 3 hits to be broken and the 3rd row would have 2 blocks together and a block's space between them. 

......

.. ..

* Level 3: This level would have 5 rows and 6 columns. The 2nd row will be having blocks that would require 3 hits to be broken. The 4th row would have 2 blocks with 2 blocks' space between them. The blocks in the 4th row would be called a bomb and would go off on 1 hit. They would also damage all the neighbouring blocks. The 5th row would be one complete row with no space between the blocks. 

......

All the levels would have the paddle moving at constant speed but this could change if the player catches a power-up. Some blocks in all the levels would be the powerup blocks that would drop a powerup to be caught by the player. 

### Bricks Ideas
* Normal Blocks: They require 2 hits to be broken.

* Stone Blocks: Dark colored blocks that require 3 hits to be broken.

* Bomb Blocks: They require 1 hit to be broken and also damage the neighbouring blocks. 

* Powerup Blocks: Require 2 hits to be broken and drop a powerup that has to be caught by the player. 

### Power Up Ideas
* Slowdown: The ball speed slows down to 1/2 of the original speed for the next 10 seconds.

* Superball: The ball is able to exert 2x times the damage it normally exerts for the next 10 seconds.

* Extralife: The player gets an extra life in the level he/she is playing. 

### Cheat Key Ideas
* C - catches the ball and releases the ball when C is pressed again 
* D - gives an extra life to the player 
* F - restarts the game from beginning. The score is set to 0
* W - increases the speed of the paddle by 2x for the next 10 seconds 

### Something Extra
* When 10 blocks are left, the space between the blocks and the paddle decreases by 1/2 so the game becomes tougher for the player. When only 4 blocks are left, the space decreases by 1/4th.
